How so?</p> <h2>Everything is Qi...</h2><p>In Chinese culture, everything that exists in the Universe is Qi. According to this philosophy, Qi moves and manifests into a physical form, and given everything that exists is just condensed Qi, the opposite process is also possible: a physical form can be dispersed into Qi.</p><br> <p>For the sake of our analysis, we will divide Qi into three components: form, energy and information. We can think of the information as computer instructions: they are the ones telling Qi how to move, and it is what causes Qi to manifest into a specific form, or what causas a form to change and/or disperse.</p><br> <p>We will mention two main sources for this information. The first one, is the one called "Natural information", meaning the information that nature follows to create new elements and destroy existing one. This is an ongoing process that started when the Universe was created. If you analyze nature carefully, you will see that everything in the Universe follows the same pattern of creation. Sacred geometry studies this patterns in detail. This information and Qi movement started when the Universe started.</p><br> <p>The other main source of information that affects the movement of Qi is the one coming from our Consciousness. Our consciousness is one of the purest Qi in the Universe, as pure as the Qi of the Universe itself, but with a main difference: our Consciousness has the ability to initiate change, it has free will to affect and alter reality. This is the reason that since ancient times, it is emphasized the work to take control over our mind and thoughts, since they recognized the power of our Consciousness to affect reality.</p><br> <p>Another important source of information worth mentioning is the one running in our particular linage which is inherited at the moment of conception. According to Chinese culture, the sperm and egg contain all the information from the father and mother, and from their respective linages. It is this information that is used to create a new life. Therefore, any pattern affecting our family for several generations will will passed on to the new life, and this process will continue until someone becomes aware and takes the appropriate measures to correct it.</p> <h2>Disease is just Qi following a pattern of movement</h2><p>From this point of view, we can see that when disease manifests in our bodies, is only Qi moving in a pattern according to the information it received, either from our consciousness or our linage. The way to correct it, at the energetic level, is through the conscious use of the mind to generate positive and healthy information to replace the old, negative patterns. This, combined with and activity to gather Qi like Qigong, can have a strong positive effect on our health.</p><br> <p>Traditional medicine always works on the Qi manifestation, on the symptom, but it never takes into account the process mentioned above, which the source of the disease in the first place. If you only work on the symptom but never work to correct the energetic patterns that caused Qi to move and manifest into that particular form disease will reappear. This is the reason why Qigong can be a great ally a an aid to any traditional treatment, as a method to prevent disease, and as a method to work on our selves and transcend our linage.</p>
