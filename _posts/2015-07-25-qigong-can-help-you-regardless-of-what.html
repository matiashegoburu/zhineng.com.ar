From studying, meditation, helping others to high performance sport. Do you want to know how? Keep reading.</p> <h2>Our activities tax our bodies</h2><p>From Qigong perspective, everything we do in our daily lives is demanding to our body. This is because, most of the time, we do what we do focused on our external reality. This is true for a person sitting in front of a computer to an athlete. The focus is always outside ourselves, and more often than not, we forget about our bodies, or even when we do focus on it, we don't focus on the internal processes that sustain life.</p><br><p>Why is it important where our focus is? Qigong says that "Qi follows the mind", therefore, when our focus is outside ourselves, our Qi will be projected and dissipated. Qi, in the Chinese culture, is the energy that animates everything that is alive. This energy is in part inherited and in part acquired from the food we eat and the air we breathe. The inherited part is finite: once its depleted, life ends. The acquired part is theoretically limitless, but we need to cultivate it. When we do, we prevent depleting our inherited Qi.</p><br> <p>In the case of people with a very intellectual activity, for instance religious people dedicated to pray, or computer programmers designing a new feature, they also incur in a Qi depletion. In this scenario, the Qi we are using is the Qi of the consciousness itself. This energy is stored in an energy center located in the center of our brains, called "Upper Dantian". This is true because when we are using our minds this way, we are have an intent: achieve enlightenment, help ourselves or others, or create a new feature for our software. Thinking is very tiring! And again, even when the activity is purely intellectual, the focus is still outside ourselves.</p><br> <p>In the case of meditation, things get tricky. When we do guided meditations, our minds are still active, therefore Qi is still being used. To avoid Qi depletion, our minds would need to be completely blank, which is hard to achieve, specially if we are beginners in this art, and even more so if our conciousness (or "Shen") is not properly nurtured. If the Qi state of our bodies is not good, it will be hard to maintain our focus given our Shen is not stable enough. In addition to this, if Qi is deficient and it does not flow freely and smoothly, we will feel very uncomfortable physically, which again will make it hard to keep our minds focused.</p><br> <p>All the time in our daily lives we are spending the energy in our battery, but, when do we recharge it?</p> <h2>Enter Qigong</h2><p>Qigong proposes to use our mind in a conscious way, to nurture and cultivate our own Qi. This Qi is stored in a energy center known as the "Lower Dantian", located in the central axis of our body, two fingers below the belly button. Qi stored in this center can be later used to nurture our body and consciousness, thus improving our health, understanding, focus and developing our full potential as human beings.</p><br> <p>Qi stored in Lower Dantian is used to support our physical bodies and all its functions, and its also the one that provides Qi to higher energy centers. It is literally our battery. So, if our main activity is a very intellectual one, Qi in this center can be used to nurture our minds and consciousness, keeping us calm, relaxed, natural, and focused. If our activities are more physical ones, we can use this energy to nurture our muscles, tendons, bones and joints to improve endurance and prevent injuries.</p><br> <p>In short, what Qigong proposes is simple: recharge our batteries.</p>
