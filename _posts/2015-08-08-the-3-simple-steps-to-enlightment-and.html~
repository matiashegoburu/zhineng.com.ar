Do you want to know what they are? </div><h2>A three step system</h2><div style="text-align: justify;">There are many Qigong styles. Some of them are modern, other ancient. And each style can be classified in one of the following categories: preparing the body for martial arts training, improve health, or achieve enlightenment. But regardless of the style, theories or age, every Qigong style must address these three stages to develop the being. The stages are:</div><ul><li>Turn Essence into Qi</li><li>Turn Qi into Shen</li><li>Return Shen to the Void</li></ul>Sounds simple, doesn't it?<br /><h2>It sounds simple, but...</h2><div style="text-align: justify;">Since ancient times, these are the three steps required to achieve enlightenment, and every system that falls into the definition of Qigong follow these steps. If we look back in time, however, we will see that very few people actually achieved enlightenment. Why is that?</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Lets look at the steps in more detail. "Turn Essence into Qi", what does that mean? Essence in this context refers to kidney Qi, Qi inherited from our parents. When we have sex, the body uses this Qi to generate a new life. This Qi is precious, and when it runs out, life ends. This is the reason that regulating our sex life is one of the first things we must do to boost our health and raise our consciousness. When this energy is not used in reproduction, it can be cultivated and sublimated, turned into Qi to nurture our Shen, our consciousness. In this way, the Shen receives an enormous amount of Qi, that stabilizes it and gives it the strength it needs to break through the Qi gates in the head, so reaching the state of "enlightenment".</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">In other words, "Turn Essence into Qi" means using techniques so that the Qi that we would normally use to generate a new life is used to nurture our own.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Then why has so few people achieved this? Well... to put it simply: sex feels good. A lot of willpower and discipline is required, in addition to knowing the appropriate techniques, to be able to do even the first step.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Lets look into the second step, "Turn Qi into Shen". Once essence is turned into Qi, it can be used to strengthen the physical body and all it's functions, not just consciousness. If we stop in this step, we will reach a longer life and a strong health. Nurturing Shen is only a required step if we attempt to achieve enlightenment and awaken our consciousness.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, "Return Shen to the Void" speaks of the process of unification between our individual consciousness with the Universe. Once the Qi gates of the head are opened, consciousness can experience and affect reality directly, without going through the senses or the physical body at all. In this state is that we can stop being an individual consciousness and become one with the All.</div><h2>Zhineng to the rescue</h2><div style="text-align: justify;">As we said, very few people achieved this through this system, given that even the first step is challenging. Zhineng Qigong attempts to overcome the difficulties of the traditional training. How? Traditional training emphasizes cultivating the inner Qi of the body and accumulate it in the Lower Dantian, to later nurture the body and other energy centers. This process takes dedication, discipline and a long time. Instead, Zhineng promotes the use of external Qi to achieve the same effect. External Qi is abundant and easily available, which makes the process of accumulating Qi in Lower Dantian a much faster and easier one.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">In China it was shown that this system is effective in awakening the extraordinary abilities of consciousness in a much shorter time of practice, and with a greater degree of success that traditional training, in addition to being very effective in improving health and promoting longevity. What are you waiting for?</div>
